# Demo Script — Elastic Travel Budget Agent

Your AI says you still have eight hundred dollars left.
You believe it.
You book the hotel.
You grab a taxi.
Then — declined.

The model didn’t query — it predicted.

Confidence without data is a well-dressed lie.

Every number must come from a real Elasticsearch query.
No records — no answer.

Built with Elastic Agent Builder and platform.core.search.
All numeric answers come from ES|QL aggregation queries.

Data first. Then answer.
